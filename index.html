              hi mahal!<br /><br />
              We're on our second valentines and I wish to spend it with you, I
              wish to make more memories with you, mahal. You are the most
              special person in my life ping, mahal na mahal kita. From being
              the boy that wasn't the best in clothing, from the boy that was
              timid and never thought he deserved anyone, from the boy that
              didn't see much hope, he saw you. You embraced me and loved me for
              all that I am, you give and show all your emotions to me and love
              me wholeheartedly. I hope you know you deserve the same, that I
              will be your light as you are to me. I will be your rock in
              everything and I will support you and love you for as long as I
              live. As long as I exist, my love for you exists. I love you
              endlessly mahal ko, I always will. I hope that throughout the
              years and decades, and our whole lives together, we laugh, we hug,
              we kiss, and love each other forever. I promise to marry you mahal
              ko, I love you endlessly. <br /><br />And so I ask you mahal, for
              all this time,
            </p>
